# ccd-image-capture
This is a project to aid with learning video capture and image manipulation.  There may be various files stored here.
This first file is done in Python and uses the tkinter and openCV 2 modules.  I will not go into how to include/ install
or use them for now.  The application in the first file works in Linux Ubunut 16.04 and uses your laptop camera to capture 
a picture.  It is basically version 0.5
